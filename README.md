# grokfoo

### A basic browser extension that lets you select text on a webpage and send to Grok with commands.

When you send to Grok, a new browser tab opens at https://x.com/i/grok, the extension waits for the page to load, injects the prompt
and submits for you.

If any changes are made to the x-grok-ui, this extension might break. If it does, feel free to submit an issue or open a pull request.
