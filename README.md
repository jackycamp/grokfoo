# grokfoo

### A basic browser extension that lets you select text on a webpage and send to Grok with commands.

When you send to Grok, a new browser tab opens at https://x.com/i/grok, the extension waits for the page to load, injects the prompt
and submits for you.

## Disclaimers

This project's code is fully open-source. Your prompts, the content you're viewing, and other relevant data are not collected.

With the help of grok and claude-sonnet, this project was created in about 30 minutes. There are some parts in the code
that could probably be cleaned up, but hey, it works for the most part.

If any changes are made to the x-grok-ui, this extension might break. If it does, feel free to submit an issue or open a pull request.

## Publishing

Publishing a new version of the extension is a manual process (for now).
Just zip the contents of the grokfoo directory and upload it to firefox-addon developer hub.

```bash
cd ..
zip -r grokfoo.zip grokfoo/ -x "grokfoo/.git/*" "grokfoo/README.md"
```
